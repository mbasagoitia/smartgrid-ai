# AI-Powered Clean Energy Grid Simulator

An interactive, AI-assisted energy planning simulator where users place and manage clean energy generators (solar, wind, hydro, nuclear) to power U.S. states over a simulated year.

The system uses real-world weather and energy data, combined with AI-driven predictions, to evaluate whether the player’s configuration can meet the state’s energy demands under realistic budget constraints.

## Project Overview

The simulator models how different energy generation strategies, geographic conditions, and storage decisions affect the reliability and sustainability of a clean energy grid.

Users can:

- Choose a state (California, Texas, or Colorado).
- Place a limited number of generators of various types constrained by a state budget.
- Choose a battery management strategy to govern how stored power is handled.
- Run the simulation to see whether the configuration successfully powers the state for a full simulated year.

## Data & APIs
The simulation integrates several real-world datasets and APIs to keep results realistic:

US Census + TIGERweb API: County boundaries and region data
NREL PVWatts API: Solar potential (irradiance, average output)
NREL Wind Toolkit API: Wind resource potential
USGS Water Data API: Hydroelectric potential indicators
EIA (Energy Information Administration): State-level energy demand & consumption data
All datasets are wrapped in a WeatherDataFacade class, providing a single interface for retrieving relevant metrics per county.
This structure hides the complexity of dealing with multiple APIs and formats.

## System Architecture

### Frontend: React + Mapbox

Displays interactive map of chosen state with selectable counties.

Users place generators visually.

Shows live updates of output, demand, and storage levels.

### Backend: Java (Spring Boot or Micronaut)

Core simulation logic and object model.

Interfaces with Python AI service for predictive analytics via an Adapter Pattern.

### AI Service: Python + FastAPI

Uses preprocessed weather and energy datasets to estimate long-term generator output, transmission efficiency, and regional demand forecasts.

### Containerization: Docker

Each service runs in its own container (frontend, backend, database, AI microservice).

Deployed to a cloud environment (Google Cloud Run)

## Data Modeling and Assumptions

Cost per Plant
Approximate 2024 installation costs, converted into "simulation credits":

Type	Avg. Cost per MW	Typical Size	Total Cost	Simulation Cost
Solar Farm	$1M / MW	100 MW	$100M	10 credits
Wind Farm	$1.3M / MW	150 MW	$200M	15 credits
Hydro Plant	$2.5M / MW	500 MW	$1.2B	30 credits
Nuclear Plant	$6M / MW	1,000 MW	$6B	50 credits

Each state receives a realistic budget between 100–300 credits, simulating political and financial constraints.

Energy Demand & Success Criteria
For each state:

The simulation retrieves total yearly electricity demand (TWh) from EIA data.

The total energy generated by all placed plants (accounting for weather and efficiency) is summed.

If generation ≥ demand for all 12 months, the state is fully powered.

Otherwise, the simulation identifies shortage periods and reports them as outages.

Transmission Loss:
A constant or region-dependent percentage of generated energy is lost during cross-county transmission.

AI Predictive Model:
A lightweight ML or LLM-assisted model predicts expected monthly output per generator, factoring in:

- County-specific weather data
- Seasonal variation
- Battery storage policy
- Transmission loss

## Design Patterns

1. Facade Pattern — Weather Data Access
Unifies multiple API sources (solar, wind, hydro, nuclear) into a single WeatherDataFacade class.

2. Adapter Pattern — AI Integration
Allows the Java simulation engine to call the Python FastAPI AI microservice using a clean Java interface.

3. Observer Pattern — Weather Updates
Each county subscribes to periodic weather updates from the facade, enabling dynamic adjustment of output across simulation months.

4. Strategy Pattern — Battery Storage Management
Defines how stored energy is managed across the simulation year.

Interface Example
public interface BatteryStrategy {
    void manageStorage(County county, double currentOutput, double currentDemand);
}
Implementations
ConservativeStorageStrategy: Stores excess energy and releases only when storage is near capacity or shortages occur.

AggressiveStorageStrategy: Immediately stores surplus but releases energy aggressively to minimize brownouts.

PredictiveStorageStrategy: Uses AI forecasts to decide when to store or release based on future predicted demand.

### Simulation Workflow

1. User selects a state and frontend fetches counties via TIGERweb API.

2. User places generators/plants on the map using available budget.

3. User selects a battery storage strategy before running the simulation (conservative, aggressive, predictive). The simulation then applies it to all counties, which affects stability and outage probability.

4. User runs simulation

5. WeatherDataFacade retrieves per-county weather and potential data.

6. AI service predicts monthly generation for each region.

7. Simulation engine runs through 12 monthly cycles:

- Updates weather

- Generates power

- Applies transmission losses

- Executes battery strategy

- Checks demand vs. generation

- Results visualized (powered % of state, outages, total CO2 saved).

- Optionally returns "optimal placement" strategy and compares against user's selection, including an explanation of why this placement would be optimal.

## Future Extensions

Extend the simulation to other states/regions

Add inter-state power trading (regional grid sharing).

Include natural gas and coal as fallback/legacy sources.

Integrate reinforcement learning for AI-driven grid planning.
